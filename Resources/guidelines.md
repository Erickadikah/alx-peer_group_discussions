## Notes

- A pull request – also referred to as a merge request – is an event that takes place in software development when a contributor/developer
is ready to begin the process of merging new code changes with the main project repository.

- A project’s repository (or “repo”) is where all the project code, product knowledge, metadata, and much more data/information is stored.

- A repository maintainer/manager is someone on a DevOps or operations team who is responsible for maintaining said repository.
